/*
A lake database provides a relational metadata layer over one or more files in a data lake. 
You can create a lake database that includes definitions for tables, including column names and data types as well as relationships between primary and foreign key columns. 
The tables reference files in the data lake, enabling you to apply relational semantics to working with the data and querying it using SQL.

Why should you register files in a lake datanbase? 
I makes it much easier to query the data in the files. No need to write the query in terms of reading and parsing a file

e.g.

# Demo 1: Create a Lake Database that sits on a Storage Account and add a table pointing to the files
######################################################
- as we will share one Lake Database together we do it togehter

- click + Lake Database 
    -> Select Linked Service to storage account (dlstrain002) 
    -> select folder with flight radar or airport data 
    -> select Data Format Parquet as the files are expected to be delta/parquet based files

- right click on the new lake database and on open
    --> click on + Table --> From Data lake
    - give it an external table name
    - select again linked service
    - select the folder.delta
    - check the preview
    - hit create table

# Demo 2: Create a external Table in the SQL Database 
######################################################
- as we will share one SQL Database we do this also together

- Show the way via SQL Create Table Statement in the SQL Database

- Then create the table via the file explorer --> with create SQL Script
